    "description": "The Origin of THE SOURCE.\nIn 2007 I took a road trip to Mammoth Mountain in California with a best friend of mine. After heading out of Los Angeles we made a wrong turn and got on \"The Grape Vine\" instead of the correct highway. This took us hundreds, maybe thousands of miles off route. We re-routed our gps and it told us to head through Yosemite National Park in an attempt to enter Mammoth from the back side. After hours of driving and eventually passing San Francisco we made our way to the entrance of Yosemite. We found ourselves driving through a blizzard which was completely foreign to us being from sunny southern California. The roads were completely iced over and the visibility was poor. My dear friend Jeff saw his first deer- six of them actually. After driving about 100 miles on ice at 20-30 mph through a blizzard we reached Tioga Pass which is at about 10,000 feet elevation (the highest highway pass in California). The road was closed, Jeff thought he saw a bear and ran back to the car. We didn't know what to do and we were very lost and very far from home. We had seen a forest ranger station about a mile back down the road with the lights on. It was just about\u00a0midnight\u00a0and we thought we were only about 20 miles or so from Mammoth. We stopped at the ranger station to ask about Tioga Pass being closed. The lone ranger informed us that Tioga pass is usually completely snowed in 10 months out of the year. He laughed at us, said something about 4 wheel drive, and offered us coffee. We eagerly accepted the coffee even though we weren't coffee drinkers, mainly because we were standing in a blizzard at midnight\u00a0after driving 8 hours or more and it's polite to accept kind gestures from lone rangers at 10,000 feet on a mountain. We were now scared of bears, fascinated by deer, we hated gps, and we were incredibly thankful that we were offered coffee upon entering the only building that we could see in the blizzard. I eventually drove another 100 miles down the mountain atop the ice, another few hundred miles back towards Los Angeles, another hundred miles or so east towards the correct highway then another 5 hours up towards Mammoth to arrive at our snowboarding vacation by noonish. One of the first things we did after driving 20 hours or so was go buy more coffee!!",

    "content": "<h1>About THE SOURCE.</h1>\n<p class=\"content\">Many first encounters, daily routines, and welcoming gestures into homes are started with coffee. What if you started your day with the most ethical consumer choice you could possibly make by enjoying the freshest roasted coffee period? Coffee that was shaped by decades of coffee growing family tradition; coffee that was not touched by Wall Street.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>VISION</h2>\n<p class=\"content\">The Source was founded to connect indigenous small-scale farmers and ethical conscious consumers. \u00a0We aim to educate consumers on making ethical choices. We live in a world where today we can make a choice between what is ethical and what pressures people into poverty. We envision a world where producers of goods are paid the real value of their crops; a world wide community in which we can buy our goods directly from a global market rather than through a commodity day trader on Wall Street.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>MISSION</h2>\n<p class=\"content\">Our mission is to give small-scale indigenous farmers worldwide a platform to rise out of poverty and directly connect to the consumers who value their hard work. \u00a0We accomplish this by purchasing our raw materials directly from the farmer and paying better than fair trade prices. \u00a0We also donate a percentage of any profits made to our non-profit arm which accumulates these profits for a micro-loan fund to finance small-scale farmers to improve their farms and overall quality of life. \u00a0</p>\n<h2>VALUES</h2>\n<p class=\"content\">Empowerment:\u00a0We strive to place indigenous farmers directly into the global marketplace enabling those who were previously pressured by corporate concentration to break through the commodity market and deliver their goods to the ethical consumers that love the results of their work.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Community: We hope that by experiencing the direct trade phenomenon; our members will realize that we are all connected in a global community that removes both the commodity day trader and the faceless corporation from the equation.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Sustainability: We ensure that the source of the products you enjoy at home are from places where sustainability is the only option. As a company we recycle everything possible, buy renewable energy credits to reduce our industrial carbon footprint, and further reduce carbon by financing small family farms that have not clear cut native rainforest in order to maximize production. The cup of coffee in you enjoy in your home is not from a plantation and was grown in some of the most remote and beautiful locations on earth</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Quality:\u00a0Our goal is to bring the best coffee period to your doorstep at the best possible price. While it may seem high compared to many large coffee companies sourcing from commodity coffee plantations, or even your local supermarket, this is simply premium coffee and any excess profits are placed back into our micro loan fund to finance the farmer for the coming season. We believe that giving the farmers the means at the beginning of the season enables them to focus on producing the absolute best possible product rather than figuring out how to feed their families.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Reality: When it comes down to the wire the direct trade priaces we pay are the difference between an indigenous family making $350 gross annual income or $2000-$3000 dollars gross annual income. While we enjoy coffee from around the world in our homes or our local coffee shop, we as consumers that love coffee are very far removed from the reality of our farmer's quality of life.\u00a0</p>"

One of the first things we did after driving 20 hours or so was go buy more coffee!!</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Although I don't know for certain, I like to think the coffee up on that mountain saved our lives. I mean, what an ice breaker; especially after travelling miles down that icy road in the middle of a blizzard atop a mountain.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">After moving to the Northwest for college many cups of coffee and more than 100 deer sightings later, my education taught me that not only was that cup of coffee completely terrible, but our lives were saved most likely at the expense\u00a0of a coffee farmer on a coffee plantation in a 3rd world country close to the Equator. A farmer that was pressured into selling his goods to a commodity market in which his labor and product was turned into $1 dollar 10 ounce bags of coffee that are used to make gallons of low-quality coffee to fuel an office building of workers. The farmer that produced the beans to make that cup of coffee up on that mountain in our time of need most likely didn't even make half of one cent from that cup of coffee that fueled us for another 14 hours of driving. If I could ever find him or her I'd give them 100 dollars for saving me from which they would probably quit their job at the large plantation they work at and buy their own land to start up their own coffee farm.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Coffee welcomes people into our homes, enables first dates, starts new businesses, starts our days, wakes us up in the morning, clears our minds, gives inspiration in meetings to create millions of jobs. This vital ingredient in so many of our lives should be chosen with care and the choice should be an ethical one.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Thinking back, if that lone ranger told me that the coffee he gave me was produced by a friend of his and that I could get it delivered fresh to my door every other week for years to come, I'd buy all my friends many years worth of that coffee. Especially Jeff. \u00a0</p>"

The coffee grows between 1,100-1,800 metres above sea level and is planted in a loose soil with a high content of clay and sand over a limestone base. The Arenas family pays scrupulous attention to detail at every stage of the coffee process. The beans are harvested by hand only when perfectly ripe, then wet milled and dried either in the sun or in mechanical dryers, depending on the weather.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">La Perla won a Presidential award at the 2006 Cup of Excellence competition and has made the auction final 4 times (2001, 2002, 2006 and 2008).</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Around 15% (493 hectares) of this vast farm\u2019s 3,285 rugged, rolling hectares are planted with coffee \u2013 of the Caturra and Bourbon variety. A further 990 hectares are set aside as native forest reserves, which are a haven for animals, birds and native plant species. The farm\u2019s rain-drenched hills are also the source of several natural springs, and its Ixtupil and Sacsiwan rivers provide more than enough water to irrigate the entire farm.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">The climate in the area is steamy, hot and humid, with 197 to 217 inches of rain each year. These conditions also support a wide selection of other crops, including cardamom, macadamia nuts and grains.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">The farm\u2019s land is scattered with small settlements, which are home to between 2,500 and 3,000 local Mayan people. Most work on the farm throughout the year, as well as tending to their own plots of land, where they grow staple foodstuffs for consumption at home. Some 500 workers have formed a solidarity association whose activities have helped to raise standards of living within the farm community.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">The commitment of its workers permitted La Perla to continue to produce during the civil war (circa 1960-1996 \u2013 the longest civil war in the history of the American continent), despite the fact that the farm was located in the heartland of the conflict between the Army and guerrilla groups, which used the surrounding mountains as a base. Over the period of the armed conflict thousands of civilians in the Ixil Triangle area were killed, tortured or disappeared as the Guatemalan Army pursued a \u2018scorched-earth\u2019 policy to destroy villages. [A UN-sponsored report published in 1999 estimated that the state was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. An estimated 83% of the victims were Mayan.]</p>\n<p class=\"content\">At the end of the armed conflict, the farm worked hard to reintegrate those most affected by the violence: the refugees who fled to save their families. La Perla provided work, reconstructed entire villages, and promoted health campaigns, such as vaccinations, that facilitated the repatriation of many whose lives were adversely affected by the conflict.</p>"

The Montecinos family implemented a major replanting progamme in the late 1970s, and Finca El Cairo is now planted out with only Caturra varietal trees.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Finca El Cairo employs around 20 permanent workers, who carry out all pre-harvest tasks on the farm such as pruning (March) and fertilizing (May). The harvest usually begins in November and lasts until the end of January, during which the workforce swells to as many as 65 workers. The cherries are picked by hand when fully ripe, pulped on the same day and fully washed. The coffee is then dried in the sun on the farm\u2019s patios until it reaches optimum humidity.</p>"
