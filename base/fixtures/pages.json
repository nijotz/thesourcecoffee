The coffee grows between 1,100-1,800 metres above sea level and is planted in a loose soil with a high content of clay and sand over a limestone base. The Arenas family pays scrupulous attention to detail at every stage of the coffee process. The beans are harvested by hand only when perfectly ripe, then wet milled and dried either in the sun or in mechanical dryers, depending on the weather.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">La Perla won a Presidential award at the 2006 Cup of Excellence competition and has made the auction final 4 times (2001, 2002, 2006 and 2008).</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Around 15% (493 hectares) of this vast farm\u2019s 3,285 rugged, rolling hectares are planted with coffee \u2013 of the Caturra and Bourbon variety. A further 990 hectares are set aside as native forest reserves, which are a haven for animals, birds and native plant species. The farm\u2019s rain-drenched hills are also the source of several natural springs, and its Ixtupil and Sacsiwan rivers provide more than enough water to irrigate the entire farm.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">The climate in the area is steamy, hot and humid, with 197 to 217 inches of rain each year. These conditions also support a wide selection of other crops, including cardamom, macadamia nuts and grains.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">The farm\u2019s land is scattered with small settlements, which are home to between 2,500 and 3,000 local Mayan people. Most work on the farm throughout the year, as well as tending to their own plots of land, where they grow staple foodstuffs for consumption at home. Some 500 workers have formed a solidarity association whose activities have helped to raise standards of living within the farm community.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">The commitment of its workers permitted La Perla to continue to produce during the civil war (circa 1960-1996 \u2013 the longest civil war in the history of the American continent), despite the fact that the farm was located in the heartland of the conflict between the Army and guerrilla groups, which used the surrounding mountains as a base. Over the period of the armed conflict thousands of civilians in the Ixil Triangle area were killed, tortured or disappeared as the Guatemalan Army pursued a \u2018scorched-earth\u2019 policy to destroy villages. [A UN-sponsored report published in 1999 estimated that the state was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. An estimated 83% of the victims were Mayan.]</p>\n<p class=\"content\">At the end of the armed conflict, the farm worked hard to reintegrate those most affected by the violence: the refugees who fled to save their families. La Perla provided work, reconstructed entire villages, and promoted health campaigns, such as vaccinations, that facilitated the repatriation of many whose lives were adversely affected by the conflict.</p>"

The harvest usually begins in November and lasts until the end of January, during which the workforce swells to as many as 65 workers. The cherries are picked by hand when fully ripe, pulped on the same day and fully washed. The coffee is then dried in the sun on the farm\u2019s patios until it reaches optimum humidity.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
