About The Source:

The Source was created to provide you with the best specialty coffee the world has to offer.  We know that the best coffee is non-commodity varieties, grown by small farmers who make the effort to grow the finest coffee in the world.  Our goal is to connect you to them - to get your coffee from The Source.

Think of us as a CSA (community supported agriculture).  We begin by sourcing the best artisan coffee varieties in the world grown by indigenous farmers in various coffee-producing countries.  We then roast the coffees to perfection, package them, and ship them to your front door!  You grind and brew your delicious coffee. It's that simple!

We also allocate a portion of profits to our non-profit organization which is dedicated to raising indigenous coffee farmers out of poverty.  The non-profit arm uses these profits to create grants that small farmers can apply for.  The Source promises to purchase the coffee grown the year a grant was made so that farmers benefit even more from your subscription!

Best,
The Source Coffee Company
